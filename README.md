# Resume_parser
Resume Parser" is a Python project designed to extract essential information from a resume document and present it in a structured format. The project utilizes various Python libraries, including PyPDF2 and python-docx, to read PDF and DOCX files, respectively.

# Approach and Advantages:

Modular Design: The parser is divided into separate functions, making it easier to understand and maintain. The functions are responsible for specific tasks, such as reading PDFs or DOCX files, extracting sections based on headers, and utilizing spaCy for entity recognition. This modular approach enhances code readability and reusability.

Regex-based Extraction: For education and work experience, I used simple regex patterns to extract information based on common headers like "Education" and "Work Experience." This approach is effective for resumes with standard section headers. It allows us to quickly extract relevant content without the need for complex NLP techniques.

spaCy Entity Recognition: To extract certifications, I employed spaCy for entity recognition, which can identify and classify entities in the text. This allows the parser to accurately capture certifications by leveraging the pre-trained language model for English. spaCy provides excellent NLP capabilities, and it's widely used in various text processing tasks.

Easy-to-use JSON Output: The parser generates a JSON output that organizes the extracted information into a structured format. This JSON output is easy to work with and can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems.
# Disadvantages:

Regex Handling: The regex-based approach for education and work experience extraction might not handle all possible resume formats. 

Handling Complex Resumes: Resume formats can be highly diverse, and some may include tables, columns, or other complex layouts. The basic parser implemented here may not handle such complex cases effectively.

Language Dependency: The parser is designed for English resumes and relies on English language models in spaCy. 
# Defense of Approach:

The chosen approach strikes a balance between simplicity and accuracy. It provides a basic resume parser suitable for many common resume formats while incorporating more advanced NLP techniques for entity recognition. The parser can handle standard resumes effectively and extract key information, such as education, work experience, and certifications, which are essential in assessing a candidate's qualifications.
